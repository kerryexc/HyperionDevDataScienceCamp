1. Normalization is a process in database design used to reduce data redundancy (repeated data),ensure data integrity (consistency), and organize data efficiently across multiple related tables.

2. A table is 1NF if all columns contain atomic values (i.e., no lists or sets in a single cell), each column contains values of the same type, and if each row is unique, meaning there's a way to uniquely identify each row (usually using a primary key).

3. A table is 2NF if it is already in 1NF and if every non-key column is fully dependent on the entire primary key â€” not just part of it (this applies to tables with composite primary keys).

4. A table is 3NF if it is already in 2NF, all columns are only dependent on the primary key, and not on other non-key columns (i.e., no transitive dependencies).
